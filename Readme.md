My little union of a shunting yard implementation, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and AngularJS.

To get this code running you will need to run these commands:

    npm install
	node app
	
Then you should see the app running on http://localhost:9000/main.html. Type your math equation into the text box and click '=' or click the buttons and then '=' to see your answer.
